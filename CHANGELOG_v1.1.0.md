## Objective 2: 12/24-Hour Time Format Toggle ✅

### Implementation Details:
1. **User Preference System**

   - **Keyboard editing:** Select cell and press F2 or start typing
   - **Auto-save:** Changes automatically saved to database
   - **Signal handling:** `cellChanged` signal connected to `on_cell_changed()` (line 352)

4. **Edit Safety**
